# Approach
- Current approach is to use language detection library langdetect, but this approach fails for some text sentences which contain multiple languages like **தமிழ்- அவனே ஸ்ரீமன் நாராயணா (Thamizh/Tamil- Avane Srimannarayana) ಕನ್ನಡ- ಅವನೇ ಶ್ರೀಮನ್ನಾರಾಯಣ (Kannada- Avane Srimannarayana) తెలుగు- అతడే శ్రీమన్నారాయణ (Telugu- Athade Srimannarayana) മലയാളം- അവൻ ശ്രീമൻനാരായണ (Malayalam- Avan Srimannarayana) हिंदी- एडवेंचर्स ऑफ श्रीमन नारायणा (Hindi- Adventures of Srimannarayana) How many of u like this???** , this contains Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam & Hindi But this is being classified as Bahasa(Indonesian)
- The model from langdetect library is not working good with translitereated indic languages, found a research work from fire 2014 which identifies the native language of every word in the sentence **https://github.com/irshadbhat/litcm**
- This approach works on strings like **Hit Like #ரௌத்திரம் Fans**, the output is [ta:0.9999993340111277] where ta is the ISO code for tamil language. The plan is to use this library with a threshold on the confidence level.
- We are also removing multiple continuous occurrences of characters by using the regular expression for example if the string is **Kola masss...... Villain chitti is back** then it is converted to **Kola mass.. Villain chitti is back**
- We are planning to use the language transliterator back into the native language, so that we can use AI4Bharat libarary for pre-processing, Feature Extraction (Embedding) at word & sentence level.
- This gives us an option to use some of the state-of-the-art algotithms like BERT & pre-trained fast-text model
